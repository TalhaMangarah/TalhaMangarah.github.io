I have an issue with Proxmox 7 with Kernel 5.11 where the LVM volumes don't get activated properly at boot. Therefore to attach them, I have to manually do it after boot.

## The Fix

1.) Find "active" volumes.
  - `vgchange -ay`, will list active volumes and volumes it can't activate
	- will probably have meta and data volume active only (may only show one at a time). Example shown below.
		- `Activation of logical volume HDD-1/HDD-1 is prohibited while logical volume HDD-1/HDD-1_tmeta is active.` \
  	  `Activation of logical volume HDD-1/vm-100-disk-0 is prohibited while logical volume HDD-1/HDD-1_tmeta is active.`
	- or use `lsblk` to view the volumes too (just change the volume text formatting to match how lv2 needs to see it e.g. "HDD--1-HDD..." to "HDD-1/HDD..."), below shows a glipse of how it looks in the terminal.
    {% highlight shell %}
    root@pve:~# lsblk
    NAME                          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    sda                             8:0    0   7.3T  0 disk 
    ├─HDD--1-HDD--1_tmeta         253:0    0  15.8G  0 lvm  
    └─HDD--1-HDD--1_tdata         253:1    0   7.2T  0 lvm
    {% endhighlight %}

2.) Deactivate the current active volumes. For me I have to deactivate `tmeta` and `tdata` from above therefore use `lvchange -an volname`, note the correct syntax (hyphens converted properly from before if lsblk is used).
- For me it looks like this:
{% highlight shell %}
lvchange -an HDD-1/HDD-1_tmeta
lvchange -an HDD-1/HDD-1_tdata
lvchange -an HDD-2/HDD-2_tmeta
lvchange -an HDD-2/HDD-2_tdata
{% endhighlight %}

3.) Finally, activate it properly now.

`vgchange -ay`

This is what `lsblk` shows after boot and before manual activation:
